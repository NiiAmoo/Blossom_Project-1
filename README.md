# Blossom_Project-1
First exercise with Blossom Academy, a notebook on data wrangling with Pandas.

The exercise was to measure my understanding of 'Tidy data'; which means each row must be an observation and each column a uniqe variable.
Both data sets had multiple columns measuring the same item. These are melted into one column making the data tidy and ready for further analysis.

Note: Tidy data is often nice and easy to work with because it makes performing vectorized operations easy. However, depending on the objective
of the analyis, it might not always be necessary to make your data tidy.
